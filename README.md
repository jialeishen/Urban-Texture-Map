# Urban-Texture-Map
**Urban texture map based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)**

This program aims to generate urban texture map of cities, which based on OpenStreetMap. Before you start running this code, osm file (OpenStreetMap XML file) of POI should be downloaded from [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (*choose POI, then click the export botton*). Besides, [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL) is necessary for running this code. Following shows urban texture maps of six different cities which generated by this code.
